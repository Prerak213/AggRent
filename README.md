An innovative tool that facilitates renting, buying and selling of used and new agriculture machinery.

# The Problem We Solved
Many farmers use old and outdated machinery and may not have the funds to afford efficient modern technology. This can slow down their production pace and result in the falling behind to modern technology. On the flip side, there exist farmers who own modern technology but aren't using it during the off season.

Our website solves both these problems by allowing farmers to rent their equipment out to others in need. The inbuilt blog furthers social interaction, benefiting users through potential knowledge gain and alerts.
